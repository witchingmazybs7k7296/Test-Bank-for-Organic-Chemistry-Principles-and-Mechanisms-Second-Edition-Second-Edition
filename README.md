  * Organic chemistry can overwhelm students and force them to fall back on memorization. But once they understand how to use mechanisms, they can solve just about any problem. With an organization by mechanism, students will understand more, and memorize less. The Second Edition of this groundbreaking text provides a fresh, but proven approach to get students confident using mechanisms.
 
  * Smartwork5 online homework supports learning by mirroring the text’s organization and pedagogy. Students use an intuitive drawing tool while receiving instant hints and answer-specific feedback, making practice more productive.
